We Out App

Application created by Saif Billah and Ronit Sharma for Mobile Application Development (CS4520) at Northeastern University.

The app is intended to help users hang out with their friends for casual outings. We hope to replace the need for multiple group chats, and to fill the need for hangouts that don't warrant their own facebook events.

Enjoy!
